        "Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that uses shifted windows to compute self-attention. This makes it more efficient than previous vision transformers, while still achieving state-of-the-art results on a variety of vision tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Swin Transformer is built on top of the Transformer architecture, which was originally developed for natural language processing. Transformer models are composed of a stack of self-attention layers, which allow the model to learn long-range dependencies between different parts of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Transformer models are not well-suited for vision tasks because they are computationally expensive to train and they do not have the ability to model local information. Swin Transformer addresses these limitations by using shifted windows to compute self-attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "A shifted window is a small rectangular region of the input image. Swin Transformer computes self-attention within each shifted window, and then uses cross-window connections to combine the information from different windows. This allows Swin Transformer to efficiently model both local and global information in images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Swin Transformer has been shown to be effective on a variety of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It has achieved state-of-the-art results on these tasks, and it is now one of the most popular vision transformer architectures.\n",
